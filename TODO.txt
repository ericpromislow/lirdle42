Need to timeout stale invitations...

Need to harvest old invitations.

End-game: Play another, or not and delete the current game.

Fix copy-to-clipboard.

Consider using the 'profanity_filter' gem and flagging anything if
finds for moderator review.

Next:

- When a user is added to the list of waiters, scroll to show them

- Don't allow a back button, particularly when selecting a word

- Send every change to the server: current-word, and marks on each selected letter

Done:
- Stop redirecting to the user's page -- it's not important
- Bring in active-channel (not coffeescript), to maintain the list of users in the home page
- Turn the list of names to links => create_invitation(from:ID, to:ID)
