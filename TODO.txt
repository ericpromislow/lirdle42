1. Dealing with stale invitations...

When about to invite a user, check for existing invitations:
[x] - delete any existing invitations from the current user to the invitee
  [x] - send a signal to the invitee that will clear any modals.
[x] - when entering a static-page, if there's an invite in progress show the modal...
  [x] - for the recipient
  [x] - for the sender
[x] - cancel any invitations from A to other users, and send a signal to clear
  a modal
- check any other invitations to that user. If they're more than 10 mins.
  old, delete and send modal-clearing signals
- ask about newer invitations...

Use a cron job to delete any invitations that are > 1 hour old.

2. End-game: Play another.

3. When a user joins, see if they're in the middle of a game. If so,
   put them there.

   Add helper: game.is_in_progress: game_states.all { |gs| gs.state >= X }

Fix copy-to-clipboard.

Consider using the 'profanity_filter' gem and flagging anything if
finds for moderator review.

Next:

- When a user is added to the list of waiters, scroll to show them

- Don't allow a back button, particularly when selecting a word

- Send every change to the server: current-word, and marks on each selected letter

Done:
- Stop redirecting to the user's page -- it's not important
- Bring in active-channel (not coffeescript), to maintain the list of users in the home page
- Turn the list of names to links => create_invitation(from:ID, to:ID)
